# AGENTS: bot/tests/fixtures

**Purpose**: Reusable JSON payloads for bot tests.

## File Context Map
- `event.json`: sample event object.
- `event_attendees.json`: sample attendee list for an event.
- `group_post.json`: sample group post data.
- `message.json`: sample message payload from the adapter.
- `writing.json`: sample user writing object.

## Rules
- Keep fixtures minimal, schema-compliant, and free of real data.
- Maintain stable IDs referenced in tests.
- Update tests if fixture structure changes.
