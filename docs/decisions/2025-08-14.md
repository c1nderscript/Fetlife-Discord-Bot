## Decision
Switch bot execution to `python -m bot.main` instead of invoking the file path.

## Context
Running the bot as a module ensures the package is resolved relative to the project root and avoids path issues in containers and scripts.

## Consequences
All documentation and tooling now reference `python -m bot.main`; developers and Docker images must use the module form.
