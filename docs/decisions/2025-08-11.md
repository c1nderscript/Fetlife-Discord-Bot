## Context
Temporary cookie files created for FetLife sessions were not cleaned up, risking buildup on disk.

## Decision
Register cleanup of cookie files via `register_shutdown_function` and destructor in `Connection` and add tests to ensure removal.

## Consequences
Ensures no stale session files remain and provides regression coverage.

## Context
Polling previously only updated cursors without relaying content to Discord.

## Decision
Send Discord embeds for new events and writings, using subscription types to select adapter client helpers.

## Consequences
Provides richer notifications to channels but increases message throughput.
