## Decision
Adopt Black for Python code formatting and define flake8 settings for compatibility.

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project previously relied on flake8 without a formatter, leading to style drift. Standardizing on Black simplifies code style and enables automated formatting.

## Consequences
- Added `make fmt` target for running Black.
- `make check` now runs `black --check` alongside existing lint and test steps.
- Contributors must format code with Black before committing.
