# 2025-08-10 - Commit message hook

## Context
Commit messages were manually checked, risking non-standard history.

## Decision
Provide a Conventional Commits validator via a commit-msg git hook and document installation steps in AGENTS.md.

## Consequences
- Ensures commit history follows agreed conventions.
- Requires contributors to install the hook locally.
